# Dotfiles and .config

Dotfiles, i.e. any file or folder that is prefixed with a dot character, are commonly used to customize Linux- or Unix-based systems. Specifically, the ` /home/user/.config ` folder contains configuration files for a lot of the systems applications. This repository is a collection of some of my personal configuration- and dotfiles.

Here is a list of the programs I use. Note that for some I do not provide my configuration. This is intentional.

* __alacritty__ - terminal emulator
* __colorscript__ - terminal colorscripts collection by Derek Taylor aka DistroTube
* __fish__ - shell
* __nala__ - frontend for the APT package manager
* __starship__ - shell promt
